RASD1 binds only to GNB1, not GNB2 and GNB3. RASD2 does. The differences are minor.
It binds with blades 1-3 (46-150).
Alpha has a helix that binds to blade 2.

The predicted model of RASD2 presents with a helix at 189-207, this however contains two prolines.
Unfortunately, the next 50 are not solved properly at all.
They are not a loop. Not fully hydrophilic. But do have a repeating hydrophobic every three.

The problem is that the first part of RASD2 (Rhes) is conserved with others while the C-terminal part is not and this binds to the G-protein.

The predicted helix ends in a proline. And is preceeded by a tyrosine. The end of the alpha helix of alpha ends in a tyrosine too...
The two helices have no smoking gun homology.

Residue C265 is membrane bound, and the last few residues are positively charged.
